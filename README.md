CI-CD pipeline
This Jenkins pipeline automates the continuous integration and deployment of a Java web application. 
It starts by checking out the source code from a GitHub repository, then proceeds to build the application using Maven. 
The code is analyzed using SonarQube for quality assurance. 
The resulting WAR file is uploaded to a Nexus repository for artifact management. 
Finally, the pipeline deploys the application to a remote Tomcat server, ensuring a streamlined and efficient development workflow from code to deployment.
